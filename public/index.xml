      <description>While analyzing some of YouTube channel we discovered that suggested videos takes 60% of total views and in this case it could be good to know, how this type of algorithms works and how we could benefit from it.
So what we should expect in future?
In nearest future, we could expect that the share of suggested views may grow up to 80% (as it already turned out for Netflix). Taking both YouTube and Netflix as they compete for the same audience, for the same watch time, we may see that they have the same ecosystem and works on the same problems related to content suggestions and personalizations but on different scales.</description>

      <description>Every time when we go to the grocery store or any other shop, we leave some data. On a micro scale this includes any checkout at a retail store. On a macro scale data is collected from groups of retailers. Generally, the point of sale data is collected by a business when some transaction happens.
This type of data could tell us a lot about consumer preferences and behaviour, but also we could imply market area models.</description>

The person behind this resource is Bob Rudis* who wrote a book along with Jay Jacobs - &amp;ldquo;Data, Driven Security: Analysis, Visualization and Dashboards&amp;rdquo;. Bob Rudis is the Director of Enterprise Information Security &amp;amp; IT Risk Management at Liberty Mutual Insurance and was named one of the Top 25 Influencers in Information Security by Tripwire.</description>

Influencer content may be framed as testimonial advertising; influencers play the role of a potential buyer or may be involved as third parties.</description>

Preface Suppose your company has a long history and you are a vivid example of a modern leader who has already heard words such as Big Data, algorithms or artificial intelligence.
The company works like a clock, although of course there are moments of turbulence. The employees are all reliable, intelligent. But for some reason, the growth is not big enough, or dissapeared.</description>
