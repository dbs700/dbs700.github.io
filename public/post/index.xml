      <title>How contrastive search can help generate Human-level text based on Transformers architecture</title>

      <description>Text generation is of great importance to many natural language processing applications. However, maximization-based decoding methods (e.g. beam search) of neural language models often lead to degenerate solutions &amp;ndash; the generated text is unnatural and contains undesirable repetitions
One of the latest research paper by Yixuan Su, Tian Lan, Yan Wang, Dani Yogatama, Lingpeng Kong, Nigel Collier introduced new approach. SimCTG, a contrastive training objective to calibrate the model&amp;rsquo;s representation space, and a decoding method &amp;ndash; contrastive search &amp;ndash; to encourage diversity while maintaining coherence in the generated text.</description>

      <title>Anomaly detection algorithms. What is it? Which tools work better and how we can add weights and features to boost the accuracy with Extended Isolation Forest via R</title>

      <description>Anomaly detection plays a critical role in any business. For instance, imagine that your streaming service suddenly experiencing some technical problems but the support team has no idea about what&amp;rsquo;s going on, or you&amp;rsquo;re running some on-line mailorder, and transactions or conversion rate dropped without any obvious reason. For these types of events, we have to implement some sort of anomaly or changepoint detection systems.
Generally speaking, anomaly detection is the process of identifying unexpected items or events, which differ from normal ones.</description>

      <title>Predicting the influence of a marketing treatment on a customer&#39;s purchase behavior. Uplift R packages overview</title>

      <description>Usually, the promotion of products occurs through communication with the client via various channels: push, SMS messages, etc. The formation of segments for promotion is solved by using machine learning. Today we will cover some of these approaches that solve the issue.
Based on Wikipedia - Uplift modeling, also known as incremental modeling, true lift modeling, or net modeling is a predictive modeling technique that directly models the incremental impact of a treatment (such as a direct marketing action) on an individual&amp;rsquo;s behavior.</description>

      <title>How Netflix and YouTube built recommendation and personalization systems with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>While analyzing some of YouTube channels, we discovered that suggested videos take 60% of total views, and in this case, it could be useful to know how this type of algorithm works and how we could benefit from it.
So what should we expect in the future?
In the nearest future, we could expect that the share of suggested views may grow up to 80% (as it already turned out for Netflix).</description>

      <title>Glimpse on a MCI/MCI2 packages - market area models for retail and service locations</title>

      <description>Every time when we go to the grocery store or any other shop, we leave some data. On a micro scale this includes any checkout at a retail store. On a macro scale data is collected from groups of retailers. Generally, the point of sale data is collected by a business when some transaction happens.
This type of data could tell us a lot about consumer preferences and behaviour, but also we could imply market area models.</description>

      <description>Recently I came across some cybersecurity articles written by Mckinsey, but then I suddenly remembered one of the brilliant resources focused on R and cybersecurity research, DFIR, risk analysis, and much more. The person behind this resource is Bob Rudis* who wrote a book along with Jay Jacobs - &amp;ldquo;Data, Driven Security: Analysis, Visualization and Dashboards&amp;rdquo;. Bob Rudis is the Director of Enterprise Information Security &amp;amp; IT Risk Management at Liberty Mutual Insurance and was named one of the Top 25 Influencers in Information Security by Tripwire.</description>

      <description>Preface Today I would like to share some insights based on influencer marketing and digital performance. Wikipedia says influencer marketing (a.k.a. influence marketing) is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field. Influencer content may be framed as testimonial advertising; influencers play the role of a potential buyer or may be involved as third parties.</description>
