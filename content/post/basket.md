## Preface

Vasily loves when they pay attention to him, he has thousands of subscribers on social networks. His girlfriend, Maria, believes that life is meaningless for show, so she carefully selects the news feed and friends, she does not eat sweets because it is bad for the figure, and buys more vegetables and fruits, plus household goods. Peter likes to read news about politics and the economy, and Olga reads more about technology and self-development. And now - attention, a question! What do they all buy at the mall?

It’s good when you know clients by sight and can prepare in advance, but what if there are millions of such clients?

The case includes category managers who manage procurement, compile an assortment matrix, re-evaluate, meet with all who can and try to increase turnover in every possible way. But is this all effective if the employee is “imprisoned” for slightly different purposes than analytics?

After the category manager modeled the scenario, usually, together with the marketing department, they identify customer needs and change the matrix. There is often a certain effect called 'bias' or bias that looks like a disproportionate weight towards one idea, category, etc.


## What are our options?

* Leave everything as it is
