What a fantastic event! Corp - Agency brought together experts and top voices in the field of Artificial Intelligence, including Yann LeCun, Thomas Wolf, Stuart Russell, Aidan Gomez , JoAnn Stonier, Wolfgang Hauner, Manuela Veloso, Philippe Rambach, Geertrui Mieke De Ketelaere, even Minister for Digital Transition and Telecommunications of French government Jean-NoÃ«l Barrot, and many many more. The event was truly a showcase of the latest in AI technology - WAICF - World AI Cannes Festival.

Certainly, ChatGPT has been mentioned more frequently than anything else, however, companies need to examine its abilities, limitations, and incorporation into risk management strategy.

The experts also emphasized not to be afraid of generative models, reminding that humanity has successfully adapted to new technologies in the past, such as the first calculator or car. Also, conversational models are very good as writing assistant, but not as a Q&A systems yet.

Deep learning will become more complex and cover end-to-end processes, from database operations to the end user solution, in a single run.

Transformers, although still relevant, may soon be disrupted by the emergence of state space models, also we should remember universal transformers. Universal transformers - underrated. Large models should be trained in a multiple regions/countries to avoid biases.

Transforming and scaling Data Science in organization can be done in six months, however requires a very strong support from Process Management and IT Infrastructure.

We can use images for time series predictions, as demonstrated in JP Morgan's Mondrian project.

Allianz created very simple and useful solution for car damage detection using CV, without any app installation.

Great initiative: Neuropin - software for augmented neuroradiology.

Sustainability was also a topic of discussion, with the experts highlighting that there are many ways to make AI more sustainable with lower costs, but the current environment and mindset often puts sustainability on the backburner.

Top challenges for AI: no hierarchical planning in general, learning representations and predictive models of the world, learning to reason, learning to plan complex action sequences. The cost efficiency of model training needs enhancement.

The number of startups and established companies that are utilizing AI to offer innovative solutions is truly impressive, and behind all those solutions amazing people that I met here.

Best advice from Yann LeCun (thanks for finding extra time to answer all the questions):

Where to find inspiration when you're top influencer: just do what you love for 20 years, social media will do the rest for you.

If you're thinking about your future and need to choose between mobile developer career/education and quantum mechanics, go with quantum mechanics.

Additionally, the tribute to Alan Turing performed at the Palais des Festivals was a stunning conclusion to Friday's evening.
