## Preface

Suppose your company has a long history and you are a vivid example of a modern leader who has already heard words such as Big Data, algorithms or artificial intelligence.

The company works like a clock, although of course there are moments of turbulence. The employees are all reliable, intelligent. But for some reason, the growth is not big enough, or dissapeared. Weekly meetings are excellent, reports are being written, but you feel that 80% of employees have lost the initiative, and 20% have not yet been found.

> Are you already chilled? - No. Still working.

So, here we will talk only about analytical reports. What you should pay attention to:

* In reports or presentations, dates are from the previous reporting period
* To the question "Why?" or "What is the connection with this?" you do not get a clear answer
* The text is half, and sometimes more, identical to the previous report (copy/paste problem)
* Data is the opposite of visualization, weird scales
* Sales forecasts are based on magic ball fortune telling or reading the latest news
* No one asks questions. Attendees are either checking the phones or dozing


## What are our options?

* Leave everything as it is
* Conduct an audit of the analytics department (methods, tools, technical skills)
