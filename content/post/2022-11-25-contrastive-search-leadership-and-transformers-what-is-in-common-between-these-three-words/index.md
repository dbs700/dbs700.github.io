### Leadership part

Leadership starts with a willingness to take risks. It doesn't matter if you're in a team of five or a group of hundreds. The point is to try new things that may be more successful or less successful. You should be willing to decide while dealing with uncertainty. This separates a leader from a jack of all trades and a master of none. Leaders know what they are good at and how to get the most out of their team and the people around them. The best leaders are the ones who have an understanding of the problems they're trying to solve and the skills and knowledge to execute those solutions. This means they have a lot of experience in a wide variety of areas and can learn from their mistakes and improve as a result. It also means they can be creative and adaptable to new situations without losing their focus on the task. This trait is hard to come by in the business world and makes leaders more valuable than their organizational status would suggest.

Leadership is not about being the best at everything but being the best at what you can do now. If you want to be a leader, you have to be willing to take the long view and look at the bigger picture. You have to be ready to learn and change your mind when you find yourself in a situation that is not working for you or your team. You have to be willing to be a problem solver rather than a perfectionist. And most importantly, you have to be willing to take a step back and ask yourself, "What can I do better?" This kind of leadership will help you grow as a leader and make you a better leader in the long run.

 

This kind of leadership will help you grow as a leader and make you a better leader in the long run. I have a hard time believing that any of us will have the time to learn all the skills we need to succeed in our leadership roles. Hence, it's essential to get the most out of your time and energy by focusing on what you can do better than the people around you. If you want to be a leader, you have to do the best you can, which means taking a step back and asking yourself, "What can I do better?" This is a big step, but it's one you can take and make a big difference in your life. You don't have to be the best leader in the world, but you have to be the best leader you can be.

### Transformers part

What you have just read was generated using novel approach called Contrastive Search with a GPT-2 XL model, 1.5B parameter version of GPT-2.

Text generation is of great importance to many natural language processing applications. However, maximization-based decoding methods (e.g. beam search) of neural language models often lead to degenerate solutions -- the generated text is unnatural and contains undesirable repetitions

One of the latest research paper by Yixuan Su, Tian Lan, Yan Wang, Dani Yogatama, Lingpeng Kong, Nigel Collier introduced new approach.  SimCTG, a contrastive training objective to calibrate the model's representation space, and a decoding method -- contrastive search -- to encourage diversity while maintaining coherence in the generated text. Extensive experiments and analyses on three benchmarks from two languages demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art text generation methods as evaluated by both human and automatic metrics.

Contrastive Search is now available on ðŸ¤— Transformers, both on PyTorch and TensorFlow.
