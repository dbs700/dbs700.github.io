How to let go of unrealistic expectations and embrace happiness getting real value from AI? Yes, right, it can be the title of the new book written by Daniel Karnegi if he were alive today.

There is a common misconception that Artificial Intelligence (AI) should be used to solve every problem. However, just like with data science there are many situations where AI is not the best solution. In this blog, we will discuss some examples of when you don't need AI. 

One situation is when the problem at hand can be solved with a simple rule-based system. For instance, if you want to create a program that checks whether a given number is odd or even, you don't need to use AI. Instead, you can simply use a set of rules to determine the number's parity. Another situation where you don't need AI is when you have a small amount of data. AI algorithms require large amounts of data to train on in order to make accurate predictions. If you only have a small amount of data, a simple statistical model may be more appropriate. 

Another popular case is when the problem you are trying to solve is not well-defined. AI algorithms are great at finding patterns in data, but they can't create meaning out of nothing. If you don't have a clear idea of what you are trying to accomplish, AI may not be the best solution. Let's check all other cases.


- When the task at hand requires creative thinking and original ideas, AI may not be the best choice. While AI can be trained to generate text or images that are similar to those it has seen before, it may struggle to come up with truly novel ideas. 

- In situations where the stakes are high and the consequences of failure could be severe, such as in medical diagnosis or self-driving cars, relying solely on AI may not be wise. In these cases, it is important to have human oversight and judgement to ensure that any decisions made by the AI are safe and accurate. 

- If the data being used to train a AI is biased or incomplete, the resulting model may be flawed and produce incorrect or unfair outputs. In these cases, it is important to carefully curate and clean the data before using it to train an AI. 

- If a task requires a deep understanding of context or cultural nuances, an AI may not be able to adequately perform the task. For example, an model trained on social media posts may not be able to understand the tone and intent of a conversation in the same way that a human can. 

- If a task requires real-time decision making and adaptability, AI may not be the best choice. While AI can process large amounts of data quickly, it may not be able to respond to unexpected events or changes in real time. 

- In situations where transparency and explainability are important, AI may not be the best choice. Many models, especially those based on deep learning, can be difficult to interpret and understand, making it difficult to explain their decisions and actions. 

- If the task at hand requires empathy and emotional intelligence, AI may not be the best choice. While some progress has been made in the field of emotional AI, most models are not capable of understanding or responding to human emotions in a meaningful way. 

- If the task requires a high degree of precision and accuracy, AI may not be the best choice. While models can be trained to make highly accurate predictions in some cases, they are not always able to achieve the same level of precision as a human expert. 

- In situations where the cost of failure is high, such as in critical infrastructure or military applications, relying solely on AI may not be wise. In these cases, it is important to have human oversight and judgement to ensure that any decisions made by the model are safe and reliable. 

- If the task at hand is not well-defined or structured, AI may not be the best choice. model, especially neural networks, typically require a large amount of data and clear rules or algorithms in order to perform well, so they may struggle to handle tasks that are open-ended or unstructured. 

At the end of the day, while AI is a powerful tool that can be used to solve many problems, it is not always the best solution. In cases where the problem can be solved with a simple rule-based system, when you have a small amount of data, or when the problem is not well-defined, AI may not be necessary, expensive or produce the same result as simple solution.
