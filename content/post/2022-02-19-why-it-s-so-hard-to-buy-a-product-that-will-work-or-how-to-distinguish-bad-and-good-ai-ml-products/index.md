Dan Luu who was a Senior Staff Engineer at Twitter, wrote a brilliant blog post explaining how in many markets, consumers are uninformed and it's fairly difficult to figure out which products are even half decent, let alone good. In this post we will summarize the point of what can say is a good AI product and what is a bad AI product and how to spot it. Let's start with good ones.

- transparency: a good AI product should be transparent about how it works and the data it uses. This allows users to understand the product's capabilities and limitations, and to trust its results. If a product is not transparent, it may be using questionable methods or data, which could lead to inaccurate or biased results

- realistic claims: it should be able to accurately describe its capabilities and limitations. Be wary of products that make overly optimistic or unrealistic claims about their abilities. Be aware of products that make overly optimistic or unrealistic claims about their capabilities.

- error correction: it should have mechanisms in place for tracking and addressing errors. This ensures that the product can improve over time and maintain its accuracy and reliability. If AI product does not have a way to track and address errors, it may not be reliable

- user experience: a good AI or any other software product should be easy to use and have a user-friendly interface. This makes it more likely that users will understand and trust the product's results. 

- good product have human oversight: in some cases, it may be necessary for AI products to have human oversight to ensure that they are functioning properly and ethically. A good AI product should have mechanisms in place for human intervention and oversight

- trained on diverse, high-quality data: AI can be biased if they are trained on data that is not representative of the population or the problem they are trying to solve. A good product should be trained on diverse, high-quality data to avoid biases and produce accurate results. 

- tests: before being released to the public, a product should be thoroughly tested to ensure its accuracy and reliability. A product that has not been adequately tested may produce unreliable or inaccurate results

- security: AI can pose security risks if they are not properly designed and implemented. A good AI product should prioritize security to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. 

- ethical concerns: some AI may raise ethical concerns, such as if they are used to make decisions that affect people's lives without their consent. A good AI should be designed with ethical considerations in mind to avoid these concerns

- developed by experts: developing AI products requires specialized knowledge and expertise. A good AI should be developed by individuals or companies with adequate expertise to ensure its reliability and effectiveness


In general, it takes few minutes for AI engineer to spot the bad product. For non-technical users sometimes it's really hard to tell if the product is bad or good without any demo or test phase, but considering all the points that we mentioned here, we can make better decision keeping all the pros and cons.
