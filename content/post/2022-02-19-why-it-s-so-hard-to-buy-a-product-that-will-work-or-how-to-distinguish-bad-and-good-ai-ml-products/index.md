Dan Luu who was a Senior Staff Engineer at Twitter, wrote a brilliant blog post explaining how in many markets, consumers are uninformed and it's fairly difficult to figure out which products are even half decent, let alone good. In this post we will summarize the point of what can say is a good AI product and what is a bad AI product and how to spot it. Let's start with good ones.

- Good AI is transparent: a good AI product should be transparent about how it works and the data it uses. This allows users to understand the product's capabilities and limitations, and to trust its results

- Good AI make realistic claims: it should be able to accurately describe its capabilities and limitations. Be wary of products that make overly optimistic or unrealistic claims about their abilities

- Good AI have mechanisms for accountability and error correction: it should have mechanisms in place for tracking and addressing errors. This ensures that the product can improve over time and maintain its accuracy and reliability

- Good AI have a good user experience: a good AI product should be easy to use and have a user-friendly interface. This makes it more likely that users will understand and trust the product's results

- Good AI have human oversight: in some cases, it may be necessary for AI products to have human oversight to ensure that they are functioning properly and ethically. A good AI product should have mechanisms in place for human intervention and oversight

- Good AI trained on diverse, high-quality data: AI can be biased if they are trained on data that is not representative of the population or the problem they are trying to solve. A good product should be trained on diverse, high-quality data to avoid biases and produce accurate results

- Good AI are thoroughly tested: before being released to the public, a product should be thoroughly tested to ensure its accuracy and reliability

- Good AI prioritize security: AI can pose security risks if they are not properly designed and implemented. A good AI product should prioritize security to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data

- Good AI consider ethical concerns: some AI may raise ethical concerns, such as if they are used to make decisions that affect people's lives without their consent. A good AI should be designed with ethical considerations in mind to avoid these concerns

- Good AI  developed by experts: developing AI products requires specialized knowledge and expertise. A good AI should be developed by individuals or companies with adequate expertise to ensure its reliability and effectiveness




Ok, but how to spot the AI products that is better to avoid?

- Lack of transparency: as we mentioned, a good AI should be transparent about how it works and the data it uses. If a product is not transparent, it may be using questionable methods or data, which could lead to inaccurate or biased results

- Overly optimistic claims: be wary of AI products that make overly optimistic or unrealistic claims about their capabilities. A good AI product should be able to accurately describe its limitations and potential errors

- Lack of accountability: a good AI should have mechanisms in place for accountability and error correction. If a product does not have a way to track and address errors, it may not be reliable

- Poor user experience: some AI may be difficult to use or have a poor user interface. This can make it difficult for users to understand and trust the product's results

- Lack of human oversight: in some cases, AI may be designed to operate without human oversight. This can be dangerous, as it can lead to errors or unethical behavior. A good AI product should have mechanisms in place for human oversight and intervention

- Biased data: AI can be biased if they are trained on data that is not representative of the population or the problem they are trying to solve. This can lead to inaccurate or unfair results. A good AI product should be trained on diverse, high-quality data

- Inadequate testing: AI should be thoroughly tested before they are released to the public. A product that has not been adequately tested may produce unreliable or inaccurate results

- Security risks: some AI can pose security risks if they are not properly designed and implemented. For example, an AI product that has access to sensitive data should be designed with security in mind to prevent unauthorized access

- Ethical concerns: some AI may raise ethical concerns, such as if they are used to make decisions that affect people's lives without their consent. A good AI product should be designed with ethical considerations in mind

- Lack of expertise: developing AI products requires specialized knowledge and expertise. If a product is developed by individuals or companies without adequate expertise, it may not be reliable or effective


In general, it takes few minutes for AI engineer to spot the bad product. For non-technical users sometimes it's really hard to tell if the product is bad or good without any demo or test phase, but considering all the points that we mentioned here, we can make better decision keeping all the pros and cons.
